What hath God wrought?
Mr. Watson come here, I want you.
Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,   
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Call me Ishmael.
Mr. President, we must not allow a mine shaft gap.
Open the pod bay doors Hal.
QUIS CUSTODIET IPSOS CUSTODES?
Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam
Did we take it lying down when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?
Oh my God. It's full of stars.
He loved Big Brother.
Some animals are more equal than others
Who let the dogs out?
There's no crying in baseball.
Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
In the forests of the night;
What immortal hand or eye,
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
In what distant deeps or skies.
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand, dare seize the fire?
And what shoulder, & what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand? & what dread feet?
What the hammer? what the chain,
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp,
Dare its deadly terrors clasp!
When the stars threw down their spears
And waterâ€™d heaven with their tears:
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
We're going to need a bigger boat.
I Was Wondering About This Error Message, I said
Beneath my stare began to blur
10,000 lines of print.

Up from my chair, I neared the lair

With puzzled gaze I paraphrased
My minds perplexing gloom.

I cannot guess where in that mess
Ill find the missing key.
The clues are everywhere, he said.
And I began to think
Of : Water, water everywhere
But not a drop to drink.

My jaw had slackened to my knees;
A fly flew in my mouth.
I gathered up my SYSUDUMP
And crawled off in a slouch.
Back to my desk; I placed to rest
My chin upon my hand.
My weary eyes seemed quite surprised
To gaze on print again.
Beneath my stare began to blur
10,000 lines of print.
